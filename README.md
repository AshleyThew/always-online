# always-online
# Overview
Hate mojang servers being offline? Same with me. So to resolve this issue, I have created AlwaysOnline. A plugin that keeps your bukkit, spigot, paper or bungeecord server online while mojang is offline.
# How it works
The plugin is set to a repeating task with a configurable delay, to see if the session servers are offline. If they are, the plugin will go into mojang offline mode. When in this mode, the server will allow players to login if their ip matches from their last authenticated login. If they don't match, it denies them from logging in. The plugin will also deny new players from joining if the mojang authentication servers are down.

Works with: **Bungeecord, Velocity, Spigot, Paper, Bukkit, Sponge**

# Sponge Support
To use AlwaysOnline with Sponge, follow these steps:

1. Download the AlwaysOnline plugin and place it in your Sponge server's `mods` directory.
2. Start your Sponge server. The plugin will automatically create a configuration file in the `config/alwaysonline` directory.
3. Edit the configuration file to suit your needs.
4. Restart your Sponge server to apply the changes.

The plugin will now keep your Sponge server online even if the Mojang servers are offline.
